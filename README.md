Special Thanks to YPlag!

n.b. :
ls-test.sh always prints error for flag error and permission denied due to buffer latency

### TODO ###

* handle -R with arg "./././ [...]"
* flag order matter : 1l != l1
* error handling : it could be nice to have a generic fonction for this
* tabulation issue only for .git ... when... well sometimes. shit happens
